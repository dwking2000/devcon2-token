# Devcon2 Token

An token issued to each person attending Devcon2.

The tokens are housed in an [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20)
compliant contract. 

* Each address may own exactly 1 token.
* Each token is associated with a string value, referred to as the identity.  This
  value is immutable.

The contract is permissioned to allow minting of tokens only through midnight
on Wednesday UTC.  After this period no new tokens will ever be mintable and
the total supply will be forever fixed.

# Why

It's an experiment to see what people do with it.


# How to get your token.
